# Movie Watchlist: register, add, watch, rank

The Movie Watchlist was my biggest project so far. It is the final project in the Flask Web Development certification I took last February (2023).

It consists in a web app that allows registered users to have a unique movie watchlist online. 
After registration, you can add any movie you like to your watchlist and mark when you watch it.

The app includes an important accessibility feature: dark/bright mode, so all eyes can feel comfortable. 
Also, it will save the date you last watched a movie and it's possible to rank it with 1-5 stars.

* **Index Page:**

<img
  src="/img/index.png"
  alt="Index page"
  style="display: inline-block;  padding: 10px; max-width: 300px">
  
* **Register Page:**

<img
  src="/img/register.png"
  alt="Index page"
  style="display: inline-block;  padding: 10px; max-width: 300px">
  
* **Toggle Theme:**

<img
  src="/img/toggle_theme.gif"
  alt="Index page"
  style="display: inline-block;  padding: 10px; max-width: 300px">

* **Adding a movie:**

<img
  src="/img/add_movie.gif"
  alt="Index page"
  style="display: inline-block;  padding: 10px; max-width: 300px">

* **Editing/Ranking a movie:**

<img
  src="/img/edit_movie.gif"
  alt="Index page"
  style="display: inline-block;  padding: 10px; max-width: 300px">

## Last words
The app was made in Flask and the data is saved thanks to MongoDB. 
Doing this granted me tons of learning: it was a great experience to pass through all the stages of programming something bigger and more complex and an excellent way to close the Flask course.

**Please, feel free to [try it](https://movies-watchlist-7dwn.onrender.com/login/) by yourself: it's a lot of fun =D**
